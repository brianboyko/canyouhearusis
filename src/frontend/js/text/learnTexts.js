        "In the history of constitutions across the world, America has had a unique place: Ours was the first constitution ratified by the people in convention. But Iceland has now done something much more significant: For the first time in the history of the world, and using a technology only possible in the 21st century, the people of a nation have crafted their own constitution through an open and inclusive crowd-sourcing process. Yet astonishingly, that constitution remains unenforced.",
        "As everyone in this nation knows, after the financial disasters of 2008, the citizens of Iceland began a process to claim back their own sovereignty. Building on the values identified by 1,000 randomly selected citizens, Icelanders launched a process to crowdsource a new constitution. That initiative was then ratified when the Parliament established a procedure for selecting delegates to a drafting commission. More than 500 citizens ran to serve on that 25 person commission. Over four months, the commissioners met to draft a constitution, with their work made available for public comment throughout the process. More than 3600 comments were offered by the public, leading to scores of modifications. The final draft was then sent to the parliament and to the people. More than 2/3ds of voters endorsed the document as the basis of a new constitution.",
        "Never in the history of constitutionalism has anything like this ever been done. If democracy is rule by the people - if the sovereignty of a democratic nation is ultimately the people - then this process and the constitution it produced is as authentic and binding as any in the world. Yet the parliament of Iceland has refused to allow this constitution to go into effect. And the question that anyone in the movements for democracy across the world must ask is just this: By what right?",
        "No doubt, the procedure for crafting and ultimately ratifying the constitution included as the final step Parliament’s sanction-just as the procedure for selecting a government in Britain is subject ultimately to the Queen’s sanction. But the Queen understands the limited power that right conveys-if Britain is to call itself a democracy. And the same is true of Iceland. When the people have acted as they have here-by crafting a constitution in the most inclusive and reflective way that has ever, in the history of constitutionalism, happened, and then endorsed that work by a popular vote, by what moral authority does the Parliament now say no? No doubt, there are parts of the constitution that some don’t like. But democracy is not a promise of perfection. And no constitution in the history of the world has ever been loved by everyone it affected - just ask the million African slaves whose freedom was made unconstitutional through 1808 by America’s popularly ratified constitution. The question for Iceland is who is sovereign? Is it the people or is it not? And if it is the people, will the people demand that their will be respected?",
        "This is a question, of course, for Iceland. But it is also a question for the world. As notions of sovereignty have evolved across time - from god, to a king, to an elite, and finally, to the people - the people of the world look to each other for inspiration. The work of Iceland’s people in crowdsourcing a constitution has inspired millions. The resistance of Iceland’s parliament has puzzled many more. Thomas Jefferson, drafting America’s Declaration of Independence, spoke of the people’s “unalienable right to alter or abolish” a constitution. In 2016, we should finally amend his words to make the point even clearer: It is the inalienable right of a people to alter, or abolish, or establish a Constitution. At least where the people rule."

        "Iceland is a very interesting country. With its small population, it can, more easily than larger countries, experiment and innovate in social organization. For instance, it has held its bankers liable for what happened in 2008, while no other country had the courage to do so.",
        "The constitutional draft written in 2012 is another impressive and innovative achievement. Coming out of a bottom-up process involving a large citizen forum defining the key values of the country and an election of a smaller council which proceeded in a remarkably open way, it is a unique blend of popular wisdom and expertise. And perhaps that is why it has stalled in the parliamentary process.",
        "What is at stake? Perhaps, the very essence of democracy. There are two conceptions of democracy. The conception that dominates in usual public discourse about the “democratic countries” was theorized by the Austrian-American economist Joseph Schumpeter, for instance. It sees democracy in institutions that allow for competition in public offices, with a system of elections from which few normally able adult citizens are excluded. Some countries are less democratic than others when they erect barriers that make it difficult for voters to access the polling stations, “gerrymander” districts to engineer artificial majorities, or exclude some political groups from the competition on dubious grounds. But, according to this conception, an open and fraudless electoral system is enough to have a thriving democracy.",
        "There is, however, another conception of democracy that is generally supported by popular wisdom. It does not see democracy in political competition but in the possibility for everyone to have a say in the decisions that affect one’s life, in all domains and not just in the general political decisions. According to this more demanding conception, democracy is lacking when the key economic and political decisions affecting the lives of citizens are influenced by unelected elites and lobbyists, when the media are controlled by particular interests, or when the funding of political campaigns is a channel of occult influences.",
        "This conception is supported by popular wisdom because everyone wants control over one’s life, and such control is thwarted when power is captured by an oligarchy in the organizations where important decisions are made. This conception of democracy is completely in line with the ongoing push for the empowerment of women in the family and in society at large, for the empowerment of stakeholders in corporate governance, and for a greater control of citizens over economic and social affairs.",
        "Which brings us back to the Icelandic constitutional draft. The way in which it was drafted, with open participation by many citizens, is itself a vibrant expression of the philosophy of participative democracy. Moreover, its text also pushes in the same direction. It characteristically does not just sanction basic human rights and basic parliamentary institutions. It also requires transparency in media ownership and political funding, publicity of public administration proceedings, it asserts “the right to an adequate standard of living and social security,” access to health care and education, it imposes constraints on the appropriation and exploitation of natural resources to preserve public interest and protect future generations, it regulates conflicts of interests in parliament. All these provisions can be read as promoting the citizens’ ability to have a greater control over their lives, their private and their common interests. Is this what the incumbent class of politicians is afraid of?"

        "To be effective, democracy demands that its citizens participate in governing themselves. In my opinion, that governance must start a very local level; a level that demands that participants meet and face each other. I have observed how this process works for almost my entire life.",
        "The remarkable effort by the people of Iceland to write a new, grassroots constitution is the greatest political tale of the 21st century. 25 Icelandic citizens, not part of any entrenched political power structure, met, argued, cajoled, listened, worked out differences, and finally, crafted an astonishing new constitution. It was a process of “face-to-face democracy” that represents the best of what democracy has to offer as a system of government.",
        "To be clear, I am an American who loves American democracy and the U.S. Constitution that supports it. American democracy is messy, imperfect, and frustrating. At its best it gives me, as a citizen, control over how I choose to be governed. At its worst, it can lead to the uncompromising gridlock that currently seems endemic in the federal government. The U.S. Constitution can seem outdated and its language terribly vague. It’s open to maddening and frustrating degrees of interpretation. Yet, I wouldn’t dream of trading away the rights it gives to me as an individual.",
        "I learned to value the local politics of democracy at an early age. At six years old, I accompanied my father (an election district chairperson) on the streets of Newark, New Jersey, as he knocked on doors to get his neighbors to sign petitions for political candidates. He represented a big city political “machine,” but to him all politics were personal. He engaged each person in conversation, got to know them, and convinced them to give their support. As I campaigned for candidates throughout my life, my success (or failure) came from that same personal contact with potential voters.",
        "I live in upstate New York in a small village. In New York, a village is the smallest governing district. My village government consists of a mayor and two trustees. 200 votes is often sufficient to be elected. The board makes decisions about the village tax rate, snow removal, road and sidewalk repair, trash disposal, and sewer and water systems. All those issues are very real and personal to village residents. To get elected, a board candidate knocks on doors (including mine) and gets to know the people he or she will represent. This system of face-to-face democracy makes government personal and real.",
        "The night I wrote this reflection, I signed a candidate’s petition. We stood on my front porch and discussed everything from the qualifications of local candidates to which of my neighbors was making soup to ward off the recent cold weather spell - all part of the process of face-to-face democracy.",
        "All the things I have described make me feel included in the process of democracy. I feel as if I have a personal stake and a voice in the process of democracy in my village, state and nation.",
        "Clearly the people of Iceland felt their quest for a new constitution needed ownership by its citizens. Their process for selecting the group that wrote the new constitution was undeniably inclusive. Their embracing of new technology and use of social media were revolutionary methods of giving every citizen a voice and personal stake in a new model of democracy.",
        "The people of Iceland deserve our support and our greatest respect for their commitment to creating a new constitution and a new form of face-to-face democracy. Their innovation, dedication, and commitment should be a model for the world."

        "In the early 2010s, the world’s attention was riveted by what became known as the Arab Spring. Women and men across the Arab world mobilized social media tools such as Facebook and Twitter to organize, document, and publicize their efforts to bring down repressive regimes. Around the same time, Iceland’s experience in crowd-sourcing the Constitution demonstrated that 21 st century social media tools could be used to build a participatory democracy. When faced with the monopolization of decision-making by the elite, Icelandic activists provided alternative platforms for collective decision-making, such as referenda, the “parliament of the streets,” and a people’s national assembly.",
        "Even though decisions that these bodies made were nonbinding, they articulated and publicized the choices that the public made collectively, profoundly challenging older, non-participatory and elite-based forms decision-making. Icelanders opened up spaces that allowed ordinary people to create new visions for the future of their country, combining social media and face-to- face deliberations, creating a new kind of participatory process that eventually became a model for “official” constitution writing that the government later authorized.",
        "Indeed, Iceland’s experiment with digital democracy demonstrates that it is possible to use twenty-first century social media tools to create a new form of participation so that, in the words of the Constitution’s preamble, “everyone has a seat at the same table.” Such a democracy is of, for, and by the 99%, or “the rest of us” as political theorist Jodi Dean so eloquently puts it. It is grounded in a collective norm that insists on having a say in decisions that affect our lives and in the power relations to which we are subject. As one Icelandic participant said, “it can be done, we have shown that.”",
        "Given the specificity of conditions in Iceland-its small, well-educated, ethnically homogenous population, almost all with access to the internet-some skeptics have questioned whether Iceland’s constitutional innovations can be replicated in deeply stratified, multi-ethnic, multi-lingual contexts with larger populations such as the United States or India.  That question is an open one, of course, but we would like to note that small countries have often taken the lead in extending and deepening democratic practice.",
        "For example, in 1893, New Zealand became the first country to implement universal adult suffrage, paving the way for a practice that is now an accepted-if not fully realized-democratic norm.  Now, Iceland is showing the world how to democratize democracy once again, using twenty-first century technologies to create new norms of participation that take constitutional democracy to the next level. Unfortunately, the Icelandic parliament has not voted on the Constitution, ignoring the 2012 referendum in which more than 2/3 or Icelanders voted to approve it.",
        "Spring 2016 brings to Icelanders an opportunity to lead a resurgence of energy and optimism for the possibility of democratic change. Building on the momentum generated by the success of the people’s protests that recently led the Prime Minister to resign, activists are pressuring Parliament to vote on the Constitution at last. In late May, Icelanders will reconvene the parliament of the streets to re-present the Constitution to the Parliament. In good participatory form, this will be accompanied by days of collective analysis and dialogue about the constitution itself. In the words of one Icelandic activist, “Even though we are a very tiny island, we can have a role to play in the world... ; Iceland is kind of like a laboratory, it’s a laboratory for a kind of a new world model... What we are doing with grassroots, with crowd-sourcing our vision and our values... ;  is a kind of a new development of democracy.” From across the ocean, we join you in hope and struggle to bring this new form of democracy to fruition at last: a democracy for the rest of us."

        "Iceland has a unique opportunity to remake its government. Its people, acting in concert with Parliament and through a Constitutional Council, prepared a revised constitution. The people approved the draft, then made a simple request to their elected representatives: hold a vote. Accept our reforms or reject them. Yet for over three years, Parliament has failed to act. What now?",
        "In the United States, we believe that ours is a government “of the people, by the people, for the people.” The fundamental principle of a representative republic is that the people grant a government its powers, to be exercised for the people’s benefit. Central to this view is the people’s right to alter or reform their government when it ceases to serve their needs-this is the essence of popular sovereignty. The people created the government; it exists for their benefit; and the people retain the power to remake it. Indeed, the California constitution expressly reserves that power to the people and describes a process for reforming the existing government. Using the prescribed constitutional revision process is the first remedy for an unsound government. This the people of Iceland have attempted, to no avail. That is not the end of the matter. Instead, the next remedy is to redouble the reform effort by using all of a republic’s traditional tools and liberties: speak out, publish, assemble, and demand action from parliament. They are your agents-instruct them. Note which members stand against reform, and vote them out in the next election. Run against them. Have faith-history has demonstrated the durability of democratic institutions bent on popular self-government. If the people want freedom, they can win it.",
        "History offers a different lesson for governments that prevent the people from accomplishing their ends. Iceland’s Parliament should listen carefully to its electorate. When the democratic process collapses, and a government breaks faith with its citizens by acting for its own preservation rather than in the people’s best interest, only the ultimate remedy remains: popular revolt. This is a hard-learned lesson in the United States, a nation twice-born of revolution. The Declaration of Independence is a revolutionary manifesto: whenever government “becomes destructive” of the ends of “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness,” it is the people’s right “to institute new Government.” And our President Abraham Lincoln was blunt when facing another great constitutional crisis: “Whenever [the people] shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it, or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it.” America’s founding and our Civil War teach that citizens must take responsibility for managing their government, and for remaking failed institutions.",
        "Iceland faces a stark choice between reform either through legal processes, or by other means. To be clear, we do not advocate the use of force. American history is characterized by negotiation through armed conflict, and it has not always gone well for us; here the United States may be more a cautionary tale than an example to follow. But there is no dispute that Iceland’s people have only three courses of action. (We do not view giving up as an option.) It is by now clear that the first remedy (popular constitutional reform) has proved futile. The ultimate remedy-revolution-is extreme. Thus, an aggressive campaign pursuing the second remedy is the best course. Vote out uncooperative members of government. Run against them. Replace them with representatives who understand that government receives its power from the people. It is said that every nation gets the government it deserves. If you want a good government in Iceland, you have to earn it.",

        "Iceland did something about the 2008 economic collapse that few other countries even dream of: it reconsidered its values. In a uniquely pragmatic assessment of how the working principles of a political system allowed for political behavior that brought Iceland to the brink of collapse, Icelandic citizens decided it was time to see their values enshrined into a new Constitution to reorient their own political system. Yet the Parliament refuses to consider this grassroots constitutional change.",
        "Faced with a democratic process without precedent in constitutional history, the Icelandic Parliament is unmoved by the call of its people. What is under debate here is the essence of democracy itself, from the perspective of values and process. Democratic values have to do, at their core, with broad participation open equally to all stakeholders. The test of popular participation has been passed in Iceland: the grassroots efforts led to the random selection of 1500 citizens who were asked to define core values. More than 500 argued for the chance to participate in a drafting commission with 25 seats. The openness of the process is unprecedented in the history of constitutional change. The drafts were not only the work of broadly selected representative voices, but they also benefited from the input of no less than 3600 comments, and garnered the support of 2/3 of the population. The democratic test has been passed with flying colors and Iceland can now boast a uniquely modern and democratic “crowdsourced” constitutional process that stands as a model to the rest of the world. The legality test has also been passed: Parliament itself established the procedure to select those participating in the drafting of the document. Yet when the constitutional document was finally completed, the Icelandic Parliament, instead of celebrating its historical breakthrough, chose to table it for three long years.",
        "So what is the next step in Iceland? One option would be to wait. An advocate of the constitutional reform noted that this Parliament won't be the last. Democracy is also about vetting and procedure, and politicians can be voted out of office. But this approach requires waiting for the next election round and fighting the fight at that time, while ignoring the fact that the voice of the demos has already spoken. Waiting for what is seemingly a democratic process is sometimes undemocratic, especially when the voice of the people itself is deferred. It is perhaps procedurally pragmatic to wait, but it dents a hierarchy of democratic values in which the people should come first and not second to political elites and interests. Iceland should not put its democracy on ice.",
        "As an Eastern European formed by the spirit of Vaclav Havel’s “power of the powerless,” I cannot help but think that this is a time for renewed opposition and nonviolent protest. Nonviolence works and it is particularly democratic. The voice of democratic pressure can take a variety of forms, many of which I already see happening: discussions, gatherings, letters, responses, but much more can be done to symbolically colonize the political space. Opposition in public spaces, performed through anything from marches across the country, sit-ins around government buildings, to public music, theatrical performance, and poetry readings have a long tradition of healthy political disruption. The ritual of creative protest can complete the cycle of the “Kitchenware revolution” by restaging the political fight in symbolic, nonviolent terms. As Havel would tell us, it is the environment of power that needs changing, and it is disruption that changes political minds."

Serious doubts about solidarity and power relations in the EU have been raised, particularly, about the way the Greek government was forced to implement austerity measures that contradicted the will of the people and have been called unsustainable even by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The Twitter hashtag #thisisacoup which was trending after the temporary settlement of the EU-Greece conflict in June last year demonstrates the worrying situation of democracy in Europe.",

Living conditions for the majority of people living in the UK are deteriorating with every new wave of austerity measures, and government programmes for tackling ‘extremism’ have put a chilling effect on pluralistic democratic discourse. With the new ‘Investigatory Powers Bill’ which is likely to be adopted later this year, the mass surveillance powers criticised in the Snowden revelations are expanded and codified in law.",

Policy reform proposals such as the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative (IMMI) suggested comprehensive new development models for the country, and a new constitution was created through an open and inclusive grassroots process - by the people for the people. A commission of Icelandic citizens drafted the text, several thousand comments were offered by the public, and a referendum adopted the final outcome.",

They have demonstrated that the uninspired stasis of current European politics, mixed with authoritarian and exclusionary tendencies, is not the only possible reaction to security threats and economic hardships. On the contrary, they show that democracy is alive - even, and especially, in times like these - and that we as people are able to create new foundations for how we want the state to look and how we want our lives to be."

Deep inside, everyone knows: there won’t be a simple solution. No national answer to global problems is to succeed. Yet, fear is breaking its way. And with it the calls to throw overboard the captain... ;",
        "Populist parties gain ground by playing on uncertainty. By doing what those not ‘in charge’ can do: levelling unconstructive criticism and fueling negative emotions. They succeed by offering crude solutions to complex problems, painting a world in black and white. These simple “solutions” are not only unrealistic - they are in large part entirely false and would even create more problems than they solve. The pathway that leads to these solutions is equally dichotomous: the ‘good’ people replace the ‘evil’ elite. In this context populists advocate a stronger voice of “the people”. To make the “will of the people” matter, populists all over the globe call for more “direct democracy” in the form of referenda. This is not a coincidence. Yes/No-answers to intricate questions closely fit their simplifying philosophy.",
        "The recent Brexit perfectly illustrates the danger of this “populism-‘n’-referendum” blend: In June 2016 the British people were asked whether they want to be in or out of the European Union (EU). The promises ‘Leave the EU’- populists made were manifold - and tempting: no more immigrants; an enhanced National Health System (NHS) instead of EU budget contributions; regained control and sovereignty in the international sphere; Single Market privileges without the duties of EU membership. They promised: We could have it all! Sovereignty, power, control - without any costs. These arguments did not - and were never supposed to - appeal to people’s ability to make rational decisions. They spoke to emotions, to pride and nationalism, to hate and frustration.",
        "In the end the British voted to leave. In a couple of hours, however, they had to realize that nothing comes for free. They watched their currency plummeting, investors getting nervous, businesses threatening to leave.",
        "But profiteers of the EU were not the only ones to become anxious - all of a sudden the populists took back their claims, one after another. They admitted the NHS claim was unrealistic from the beginning. And well, ok, if we want to stay in the Single Market, we might have to pay for it. And sorry to say that guys, migrants won’t stop coming just because we brexited. The ground the leave campaign was built on became shakier with every hour passing. The referendum did not just divide British voters, it also left the parties with governing potential in disarray. It triggered territorial disintegration with Scotland and Ireland complaining that they should not be forced to leave the EU because England and Wales imposed it on them. In short, the Brexit-referendum destabilized one of the oldest parliamentary democracies in the world. ",
        "Is this the Holy Grail of direct democracy? Is this the model of participation we want to pursue? Or might there be an alternative way to give voice to citizens without dividing them? There is. Iceland leads the way. After the financial crisis had hit Iceland, its citizens decided to regain control of their own fate - and followed a distinct path. They came together and formed a Constitutional Council. In a bottom-up process, 950 randomly selected citizens came together to deliberate and concluded that a new constitution was necessary for their crisis-ridden country; this task was assigned to 25 randomly selected citizens drafted a new constitution for their crisis-ridden country. During this bottom-up process, Icelandic citizens debated about the very basis of their society, negotiated priorities, and decided based on the unanimity principle. No one was to be overruled, no one lost her face, no one was ignored.  The Icelandic method of direct democracy and participation in decision making thus relied on a completely different interpretation of direct democracy. In sharp contrast to referenda, it did not polarize the population. Instead, the Icelandic way was based on deliberation, on compromise-seeking and building. It is a method that is not divisive but unifying.",
        "Moreover, the process of deliberation helped to reduce disenchantment with politics because citizens were in the position to better understand the political process and the difficulties entailed. By being directly faced with the problem and by debating with each other on how to best solve it, Icelanders recognized first hand that complex problems call for complex solutions. This is a slow, holistic approach. It requires exchange and constructive criticism. But it might allow people to achieve the best possible outcome for the entire community. ",
        "Comparing the Icelandic and the British examples of public participation in key constitutional issues teaches us some important lessons about direct democracy. First, the promotion of public participation through referenda results in splitting the citizenry into two camps that fight against each other. In this zero-sum setting, the outcome excludes the wishes and opinions of the losing side. On the contrary, the random selection of citizens to deliberate on important matters of the entire community ensures not only that different opinions are heard, but also that the outcome will be as inclusive as possible. ",
        "Second, these two different methods of involving the citizens give them two entirely different senses of empowerment: In the case of referenda the power of citizens is limited to a choice between two pre-defined options. Applying oneself in any other way is to no avail. In the other case, the Icelandic method, citizens are encouraged to engage in a fruitful way, to find creative and complex solutions which might raise the feeling of ownership. ",
        "Third, the Icelandic method of randomly selecting citizens is much closer to the original concept of direct democracy, which was born in Ancient Greece: citizens who wished to participate in the assembly put their names on a list. While lot determined who would go to the assembly, the terms were short enough to give as many citizens as possible the opportunity to deliberate and decide on community matters. Most crucially, both in Ancient Greece and in Iceland, citizens’ experience with democracy was not a single event, not a single vote, but a process.",
        "Opponents of public involvement in politics often dismiss the original concept of democracy as unable to function at large-scale. This may have been true prior to the technological revolution, but this kind of arguments are hard to sustain in an era of advanced information technology and new media of communication. In Iceland many more citizens than the randomly selected 25 council members were included in the constitution drafting process via social media, so as to bring as many ideas on the table as possible. In larger countries the involvement of millions of people and the inclusion of their ideas could easily be enabled by the synergy of scientific disciplines: computer and information science, media studies, political science, or linguistics could be used to code and analyze citizens’ contributions. Whether or not to involve the citizens is no longer a matter of administrative or technological capacity. It is a matter of political will.",
        "Has the time come for us citizens of modern democracies to dive in deeper waters? A hasty, hysterical way swimming may lead to drowning... ; But if we learn to swim in a slow and calm manner, we may even be able to survive in rough sea."
